     * Get the system wide configuration information for images. Some elements
     * of the API require some knowledge of the configuration data which can be
     * found here. The purpose of this is to try and keep the actual API
     * responses as light as possible. It is recommended you store this data
     * within your application and check for updates every so often.<br>
     * <br>
     * To build an image URL, you will need 3 pieces of data. The base_url, size
     * and file_path. Simply combine them all and you will have a fully
     * qualified URL. Here’s an example URL:<br>
     * <br>
     * <a href=
     * "http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/8uO0gUM8aNqYLs1OsTBQiXu0fEv.jpg"
